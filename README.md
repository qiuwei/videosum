Make summary  of video clips in natural language.

This project is dedicated to my master thesis in the field of computational linguistics. I want to make my work open source for the sake of open research.And I also want to track the progress effectively this way. Some sensitive Data will be not be included due to the copy rights issue.

##Introduction

##Resources
The Saarbr√ºcken Corpus of Textually Annotated Cooking Scenes (short: TACoS) contains a set of video descriptions (in natural language) and timestamp-based alignment with the videos. The videos and a low-level activity annotation of them is available as part of the MPII Composites corpus. We provide links to the subset of MPII Composites that is incorporated in the TACoS corpus.
